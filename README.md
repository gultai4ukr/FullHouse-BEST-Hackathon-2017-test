# FullHouse-BEST-Hackathon-2017-test

This project was the test task for BEST Hackathon 2017, made by team Full House (SergChr, gultai4ukr, konchyts-v, AndriiSiuta).

Main purpose of this work was creation of news aggregator, which should be pretty, easy to use and provides possibility to perform filtering by categories. And we consider that we reach this conditions mostly. We create nice site, which takes the hotest news from the best media in the world (like CNN, Bloomberg, The Washington Post, The Guardian, BBC and so on) and provides filtering by language (en/de), category (Politics/Business/Technology/etc) or country of media (Italy/USA/Great Britain).
